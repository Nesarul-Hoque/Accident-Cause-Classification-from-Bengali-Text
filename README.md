# Accident Cause from Bengali Text (ACBT) Corpus
Population density is strongly proportional to the rate of accidents. As a highly populated country, the accidental death is inreasing day-by-day in Bangladesh. Various online news portals, such as Prothom Alo and The Daily Ittefaq in this country, represent an established and credible source for accident-related news dissemination. However, accidental news is not divided into more specific classes in those news portals. Therefore, the reader faces difficulty with which type of accident-related news she/he wants to read. Additionally, getting statistical information from the manual classification system about various types of accidents is a laborious job. Moreover, an automated classification system may help the government or other voluntary organizations to provide consciousness about the major types of accidents. In these regards, we have introduced a pioneer ACBT dataset for identifying accident causes with eleven classes from the Bengali text data.
